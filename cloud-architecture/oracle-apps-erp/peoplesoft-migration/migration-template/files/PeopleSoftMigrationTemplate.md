### Value Proposition

While discussing the unique value proposition of OCI, we will focus on **Operating Systems,** **Oracle Database** and **PeopleSoft Cloud Manager (PCM)**. PCM is an orchestration framework to provision and manage Customer's PeopleSoft environments on OCI, and is only available for OCI Customers. Details about PCM are available in section **3.4.6.1**.

**Oracle Linux:** Many customers choose Oracle Linux to support their mission-critical applications. Oracle Linux is also the principal operating system for Oracle’s own Database, Middleware, and Application software engineering projects.

Oracle Cloud Applications, Oracle Cloud Platform, and OCI run on Oracle Linux. Oracle Linux is the development standard across the Oracle Database product portfolio with more than 175,000 Oracle Linux instances deployed on both physical and virtual servers.

Oracle Linux includes the Unbreakable Enterprise Kernel (UEK), which is specifically optimised for the best performance of Oracle software. Oracle engineers extensively test the optimised UEK across Oracle’s database, middleware, and application tiers as well as on Oracle servers and engineered systems.

**Oracle Database:** The Database Service in OCI offers autonomous and co-managed Oracle Database Cloud solutions. Oracle Database has the following offerings:

-   Autonomous databases (ADB) are preconfigured, fully-managed environments that are suitable for either transaction processing or for data warehouse workloads. It has two deployment options: Dedicated Exadata Infrastructure (ADB-D) and Shared Exadata Infrastructure (ADB-S).

-   Co-managed solutions are bare metal, virtual machine, and Exadata DB systems that you can customise with the resources and settings that meet your needs.

**PCM:** With PCM, Oracle has differentiated its offering for OCI customers by offering them a free application that simplifies and automates lifecycle management processes. These features eliminate or significantly reduce the pain points and challenges commonly associated with managing and maintaining a PeopleSoft application environment On-Premises. PCM provides amongst others, the ability to:

-   Provision PeopleSoft environments on OCI.
-   Automate migration of on-premise environment to OCI.
-   Support lifting and shifting of unicode or non-unicode database.
-   Support lifting and shifting of PeopleSoft application environments which have TDE encrypted databases. The on-premise environments must be TDE encrypted before migrating.
-   Support lifting and shifting of Transparent Data Encryption, or TDE, and Real Application Clusters, or RAC, for Database Systems.
-   Orchestrate deployment of PeopleSoft 9.2 and IH 9.1 applications on OCI.
-   Subscription model to auto download application PIs and PRPs.
-   Create repeatable deployment templates.
-   Self service provisioning of PeopleSoft environments.
-   Fully automate deployment which is immune to manual errors and process delays.
-   Manage multiple environments from a single page.
-   Enable application lifecycle management in Oracle Cloud.

Additionally, all the activities mentioned within the scope will ensure the deployment of workload as per Oracle's best practices. As a tried and tested methodology by many customers 'Oracle Lift' brings speed of deployment resulting in successful project without any setbacks; thus it brings value to the overall project provisioning for the Application workload.

# Workload Requirements and Architecture

## Overview

*Guide:*

*A section describing the Current PeopleSoft workload of the Customer. Describe the Workload: What applications and environments are part of this Workload, specify their names and details. The implementation will be scoped later and is typically a subset of the Workload. For example, a Workload could exist of two applications, but the implementer would only include one environment of one application. The workload chapter is about the whole Workload and the implementation scope will be described late in the chapter. [Scope](#scope).*

*Example:*

Currently Customer's PeopleSoft workload is a multi node deployment with PeopleTools release 8.58 and PeopleSoft Application version is 9.2. The Application tier is connected to a 19C Oracle Real Application Cluster (RAC) Database. The PeopleSoft Internet Architecture (PIA) doamin and PeopelSoft Application or middle tier consist of following components:

-   Two nodes hosting the PeopleSoft PIA domain.
-   A single external facing node hosting web functionality to support external students.
-   Two nodes hosting both the PeopleSoft Application Server and the Process Scheduler domains.
-   A shared file system for PeopleSoft application software and report repository.

There are two client connection routes for the PeopelSoft Workload: one is internal via a WAN and another external via the internet. Both routes employ https which is terminated on a load-balancer. The reporting elements of the solution are provided using Oracle Business Intelligence Enterprise Edition.

## Non-Functional Requirements

*Guide:*

*Describe the high-level technical requirements for the Workload. Consider all sub-chapters, but decide and choose which Non-Functional Requirements are necessary for your engagement. You might not need to capture all requirements for all sub-chapters.*

### Regulations and Compliances Requirements

*Guide:*

*This section captures specific regulatory or compliance requirements for the Workload. These may limit the types of technologies that can be used and may drive some architectural decisions.*

*The Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Compliance Documents service lets you view and download compliance documents: https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/ComplianceDocuments/Concepts/compliancedocsoverview.htm*

*If there are none, then please state it. Leave the second sentence as a default in the document.*

*Example:*

At the time of this document creation, no Regulatory and Compliance requirements have been specified.

In addition to these requirements, the [CIS Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Foundation Benchmark, v1.2](https://www.cisecurity.org/benchmark/Oracle_Cloud) will be applied to the Customer tenancy.

### Environments

#### Environment Sizing

*Guide:*

*A section describing the Current PeopleSoft workload of the Customer: Sizing Details, Current On-Premise BoM*

*Example:*

Implementation Partner will capture the current PeopleSoft workload sizing here.

### High Availability and Disaster Recovery Requirements

*Guide:*

*This section captures the resilience and recovery requirements for the Workload. Note that these may be different from the current system.*

*The Recovery Point Objective (RPO) and Recovery Time Objective (RTO) requirement of each environment should be captured in the environments section above, and wherever possible.*

-   *What are the RTO and RPO requirements of the Application?*
-   *What are the SLAs of the application?*
-   *What are the backup requirements*

*Example:*

The recovery time objective (downtime tolerance) and recovery point objective (data loss tolerance) details are very important considerations for the Customer. The overall DR requirement is a cross region DR strategy with the goal of minimizing RTO.

#### Backup and Recovery Practices

*Guide:*

*A section describing the Current PeopleSoft workload of the Customer: Backup and Recovery- RTO and RPO*

*Example:*

Current high level backup and recovery practices are described below:

-   File system and Database backups are retained for 30 days for production and at least 7 days for non-production.
-   Oracle Recovery Manager (RMAN) is the standard backup tool which handles all PeopleSoft workload Databases.
-   Backup of the Oracle Databases uses the standard file system agent which backs up the Oracle RMAN disk based backup to tape.
-   Backup frequency standards are:
    -   Weekly full,
    -   Daily incremental backup, which includes the archive log backups.

### Security Requirements

*Guide:*

*Capture the Non-Functional Requirements for security-related topics. Security is a mandatory subsection that is to be reviewed by the x-workload security team. The requirements can be separated into:*

-   *Identity and Access Management*
-   *Data Security*

*Other security topics, such as network security, application security, or others can be added if needed.*

*Example:* Security is especially critical for any core business applications like PeopelSoft. The PeopleSoft's security definition refers to a collection of related security attributes that you create using PeopleTools. The three main PeopleSoft security definition types are:

-   User profiles: Each user has an individual user profile, which in turn is linked to one or more roles.
-   Roles: Roles are intermediate objects that link user profiles to permission lists. You add one or more permission lists, which ultimately control what a user can and cannot access, to each role.
-   Permission lists: Permission lists are groups of authorizations that you assign to roles. Permission lists store sign-in times, page access, PeopleTools access, and so on.

In general, the foundation of security is access control, which refers to how the system is being accessed and by whom. User security consists of three principal components: authentication, authorization and an audit trail. All current browser-based password login screens send the password as a parameter in the HTTP form submission. Using an HTTPS connection will encrypt this information. The best practice is therefore to use HTTPS for all web-based access. The requirement is to take extra steps to ensure security is not compromised either from the Infrastructure side or from the Application endpoints.

At the time of this document creation, no Security requirements have been specified.

### Workload Access Requirement

*Guide:*

*A section describing the Current PeopleSoft workload of the Customer: How Customer access their Application*

*Example:*

The Customer wants to access the PeopleSoft workload, once they move to OCI, in the same way as they currently do On-Premises. They also need to secure their external internet-facing endpoints from internet threats.

The Customer has both internal and external endpoints of their PeopleSoft workload.

**Internal Users:**

Users access PeopleSoft using the URL https://`<Internal LB URL:port>`. The connection flows via the external/internal firewall to the private Load Balancer. Load Balancer terminates the Secure Socket Layer (SSL) connection and incoming traffic is distributed by the load balancer over port 8000/8443 (http/https). It forwards the requests to the Oracle Tuxedo Jolt port 9000 on the application server. The application server is also responsible for maintaining the SQL connection to the database over port 1521.

**Please note:** The default ports for PeopelSoft Internet Architecture (PIA) set by the DPK setup script are 8000 for HTTP and 8443 for HTTPS.

**External Users:**

External users access PeopleSoft using the URL https://`<External LB URL:port>`. The connection flows via the external/internal firewall to the public Load Balancer in DMZ. Load Balancer terminates the SSL connection and incoming traffic is distributed by the load balancer over port 8000/8443 (http/https). It forwards the requests to the Oracle Tuxedo Jolt port 9000 on the application server. The application server is also responsible for maintaining the SQL connection to the database over port 1521.

*Reference:*

[SSL in OCI](https://www.ateam-oracle.com/post/load-balancing-ssl-traffic-in-oci)

### Workload Monitoring

*Guide:*

*A section describing the Current PeopleSoft workload of the Customer: Monitoring of the Workload (like OEM or any other monitoring tools)*

*Example:*

Currently Oracle Enterprise Manager (OEM) is used as Customer's On-Premises management platform. The PeopleSoft Enterprise Manager Plug-in uses OEM to provide an integrated, graphical user interface for monitoring and managing components of a PeopleSoft environment. The entities that Enterprise Manager monitors and manages are called managed targets, such as databases, application servers, Process Scheduler servers, web servers, and so on.

The OEM product includes the Management Agent, Oracle Management Service, Management Repository Database, and the Cloud Control Console, which is a browser-based central console through which administrators can perform monitoring, administration, and configuration tasks for the enterprise.

### Networking Requirements

*Guide*

*Capture the Non-Functional Requirements for networking-related topics. You can use the networking questions in the [Annex](#networking-requirement-considerations)*

*Example:*

At the time of this document creation, no Networking requirements have been specified.

## Future State Architecture

*Guide:*

*The Workload Future State Architecture can be described in various forms. In the easiest case, we describe a Logical Architecture, possibly with a System Context Diagram. A high-level physical architecture is mandatory as a description of your solution.*

*Additional architectures, in the subsections, can be used to describe needs for specific workloads.*

### Mandatory Security Best Practices

*Guide:*

*Use this text for every engagement. Do not change. Align with the Cloud Adoption Framework.*

The safety of the ACME's Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) environment and data is the ACME’s priority.

To following table of OCI Security Best Practices lists the recommended topics to provide a secure foundation for every OCI implementation. It applies to new and existing tenancies and should be implemented before the Workload defined in this document will be implemented.

Workload-related security requirements and settings like tenancy structure, groups, and permissions are defined in the respective chapters.

Any deviations from these recommendations needed for the scope of this document will be documented in the chapters below. They must be approved by ACME.

ACME is responsible for implementing, managing, and maintaining all listed topics.

### Naming Conventions

*Guide:*

*This chapter describes naming convention best practices and usually does not require any changes. If changes are required please refer to [Landing Zone GitHub](https://github.com/oracle-devrel/technology-engineering/tree/main/landing-zones). The naming convention zone needs to be described in the Solution Design by the service provider.*

*Use this template ONLY for new cloud deployments and remove it for brownfield deployments.*

A naming convention is an important part of any deployment to ensure consistency, governance, and security within your tenancy. Find [here](https://github.com/oracle-devrel/technology-engineering/blob/main/landing-zones/commons/resource_naming_conventions.md) Oracle's recommended best practices.

### OCI Landing Zone Solution Definition

*Guide:*

*This chapter describes landing zone best practices and usually does not require any changes. If changes are required please refer to [Landing Zone GitHub](https://github.com/oracle-devrel/technology-engineering/tree/main/landing-zones). The full landing zone needs to be described in the Solution Design by the service provider.*

*Use this template ONLY for new cloud deployments and remove it for brownfield deployments.*

An OCI Landing Zone sets the foundations for a secure tenancy, providing design best practices and operational control over OCI resources. A Landing Zone also simplifies the onboarding of workloads and teams, with clear patterns for network isolation and segregation of duties in the organization, which sets the cloud operating model for day two operations.

Oracle highly recommends the use of an OCI Landing Zone for any deployment. Use these [guidelines](https://github.com/oracle-devrel/technology-engineering/blob/main/landing-zones/commons/lz_solution_definition.md) to set up your OCI Landing Zone, including design considerations, approaches, and solutions to use.

Note that all workloads in a tenancy should sit on top of a Landing Zone, meaning that the workload architecture defined in the next section can be subject to adjustments (e.g., network structure) towards the landing zone model, along with other future workloads.

### Physical Architecture

*Guide:*

*A section describing the Deployment Design and its associated Components in OCI*

*Example:*

The design plan of the Customer's Tenancy includes 2 Virtual Cloud Networks (VCNs): one is kept as 'Management VCN', and another is for 'Application/Workload' VCN. Both the VCNs are attached to the Management VCN's Dynamic Routing Gateways (DRG). Traffic will be terminated at the same DRG.

In the **following sections** we are describing the **Solution Design Diagrams for Deployment.**

*Reference:*

*[The Oracle Cloud Notation, OCI Architecture Diagram Toolkits](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/General/Reference/graphicsfordiagrams.htm)*

![Future State Deployment Diagram - PeopleSoft Workload Single AD, Customer Use case Example -2](images/SingleADCustUseCase2-V3.pdf)


## Solutions Considerations

*Guide:*

*A section describing the Future PeopleSoft workload of the Customer in OCI Describe certain aspects of your solution in detail. What are the security, resilience, networking, and operations decisions you have taken that are important for your customer?*

*Example:*

The PeopleSoft components installed by the deployment packages (DPK). It enables you to install the PeopleSoft PeopleTools Server and Client Software, Application Server, Process Scheduler, and PeopleSoft Pure Internet Architecture (PIA) domains, as well as required supporting software.

Proposed deployment plan is to move PeopleSoft PeopleTools **(8.59.21)** and PeopleSoft Application **(9.2.U37)** in the compute VM shapes on the latest OS and kernel version (which is supported). On-Premises RAC Database (**19c**) will be migrated to a VM-DB RAC system based on a multitenant architecture.

We can leverage OCI Web Application Firewall (WAF) which helps to make the application endpoints more secure by monitoring and filtering out potentially malicious traffic. It is also cloud-based, Payment Card Industry (PCI) compliant.

### High Availability and Disaster Recovery

*Guide:*

*Please describe the Oracle MAA in the context of PeopleSoft.*

*Example:*

Oracle Maximum Availability Architecture (MAA) is Oracle's best practice blueprint based on proven Oracle high availability technologies and recommendations. The goal of MAA is to achieve the optimal high-availability architecture at the lowest cost and complexity. Papers are published on the Oracle Technology Network [OTN](http://www.oracle.com/goto/maa).

To achieve maximum availability for PeopleSoft workload, Oracle recommends deploying PeopleSoft on an Oracle Database MAA foundation that includes the following technologies: - Oracle Real Application Clusters and Oracle Clusterware - Oracle Active Data Guard - Oracle Flashback Database - Oracle Automatic Storage Management with high redundancy disk group - Oracle Recovery Manager and Oracle Secure Backup

Please refer to the following high level MAA diagrams for PepleSoft workload.

![PeopleSoft Workload MAA High Level Design Diagram (With WAF for Internet connection)](images/PeopleSoftHighLevelMAA-WithWAF-V3.pdf)


![PeopleSoft Workload MAA High Level Design Diagram](images/PeopleSoftHighLevelMAA-V3.pdf)

*Reference:*

[HA Reference for PeopleSoft](https://www.oracle.com/a/tech/docs/psft-maa-exacs-tech-brief.pdf)

#### Backup and Recovery

*Guide:*

*A section describing the 'Backup and Recovery' practices of the Customer in OCI*

*Example:*

We will follow the current Backup and Recovery strategy and practices of the Customer. Customer has the following Recovery Time Objective (RTO) and Recovery Point Objective (RPO) requirements which will be achieved with the proposed architecture:

-   Official RTO practices: less than 24 hrs
-   Official RPO practices: 4 hours

### Security

*Guide:*

*A section describing the Security in OCI in the context of the PeopleSoft Application*

*Example:*

The objective of the security architecture is to enable you to maintain your security posture when running PeopleSoft workload in the Oracle Cloud.

Oracle has designed security into every aspect of our infrastructure to help our customers achieve better protection, isolation and control. We started by taking a unique design approach, separating the network and server environments. This way, if an attack occurs on a VM, we can contain that threat and prevent it from moving to other servers, resulting in better protection and lower risk for customers.

We also hyper-segment our physical network and backend infrastructure for secure isolation between customer instances and backend hosts. Additionally, we’ve implemented hardware-based root of trust, making sure each server is pristine each and every time it is provisioned.

The below diagram shows the security posture of PeopleSoft in OCI.

![PeopleSoft Network Security](images/PeopleSoftNetworkSecurity-V3.pdf)

For each customer’s VCN, there is a range of 'defense-in-depth' protections available spanning across **layers 3-7 (from OSI Network to Application layer)**. It is a practical strategy for achieving information security (often called information assurance) in today’s highly networked environments. The defense-in-depth approach builds mutually supporting layers of defense to reduce vulnerabilities and to assist an organization in its efforts to protect against, detect, and react to as many attacks as possible.

**VCN (1):** A VCN provides isolation for your workload from any other workload on OCI, including your other workloads in a different VCN.

**Internal Firewalls (2):** Implement virtual firewalls at the subnet level using VCN security lists.

**Load Balancing Traffic Securely (3):** TLS 1.2 is supported by default to securely balance traffic within the implementation and from external connections.

Secure Traffic Between ADs and Regions: Communications between ADs are encrypted with Media Access Control security (MACsec) to prevent layer 2 security threats such as wiretapping, DDoS, intrusion, man-in-the-middle and playback attacks. VCN traffic that travel between regions are either sent over private links or are encrypted.

**Secure Connectivity to Public Internet (4):** For security, a VCN has no internet connectivity by default. Therefore, internet bound traffic to / from a VCN must pass through an Internet Gateway (IGW). Virtual routing tables can be implemented with private IP addresses for use with NAT and 3rd party firewall devices (Like Palo Alto or Fortinet) for additional security. We can also leverage Network Firewall, which is a next-generation managed network firewall and intrusion detection and prevention service for OCI VCNs, powered by Palo Alto Networks. The Network Firewall service gives you visibility into traffic entering cloud environments (North-south network traffic) as well traffic between subnets (East-west network traffic).

**Secure Connectivity Between Your VCN and Data Center (5):** Traffic can be routed through a DRG for private traffic. It is used with an IPSec VPN or FastConnect connection to establish private connectivity between a VCN and an On-Premises or other cloud network.

**Protect Internet-Facing Applications (6):** OCI WAF is a regional-based and edge enforcement service that is attached to an enforcement point, such as a load balancer or a web application domain name. WAF protects applications from malicious and unwanted internet traffic. WAF can protect any internet facing endpoint, providing consistent rule enforcement across a customer's applications. It also inspects any request going from the web application server to the end user. Additionally, Oracle’s optional global 'anycast' DNS service also takes advantage of DNS-based DDoS protections providing resiliency at the DNS layers. WAF provides you with the ability to create and manage rules for internet threats including Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), SQL Injection, and other OWASP-defined vulnerabilities. Access rules can limit, based on geography or the signature, of the request.

Please note:**WAF policy** is a **regional solution** that works as a plug-in for your load balancer.

**Edge policy** is a **global solution**. Customer can leverage either WAF policy or Edge policy as per their requirements. To use WAF solution for Edge enforcement, allowlist (formerly known as whitelist) Oracle nodes throughout the world and use DNS to point your application to the CNAME that we provide.

\_\_Note:\_\_Please see generic OCI security guidelines in the [Annex](#security-guidelines).

### Workload Access

*Guide:*

*A section describing how Customer will access their Application in OCI*

*Example:*

Customer will access the PeopleSoft workload internally over the OCI FastConnect connectivity solution and PeopleSoft external endpoints will be secured by OCI WAF. FastConnect is a private, dedicated connectivity that improves security. It supports bandwidths from 1Gbps to 10Gbps. An alternative option to FastConnect is Virtual Private Network (VPN). VPN could also be a backup configuration if FastConnect is down.

### Workload Monitoring

*Guide:*

*A section describing how Customer will monitor their Application in OCI*

*Example:*

Customer will use 'Enterprise Manager Plug-in' for PeopelSoft to monitor their PeopleSoft workload. Customer can also leverage OCI Stack Monitoring for PeopleSoft or they can use both and enjoy benefits form both the services. For detail please check the below blog articles specified in the reference section.

### Cloud Manger - PeopleSoft Automation Tool

*Guide:*

*A section describing the Cloud Manager Tooling for PeopleSoft Workload*

*Example:*

#### What is PCM

-   Oracle PCM is a key component of the Oracle PeopleSoft **automation** for OCI.

-   PCM is an **orchestration framework to provision and manage PeopleSoft environments** on OCI. The PCM can help create task-specific environments that can last as long as the task is needed. PCM will enable you to focus more on business and less on infrastructure management by taking away all the complexities involved in acquiring and managing the infrastructure to run PeopleSoft on OCI.

-   PCM is an application available on the Oracle Cloud Marketplace. Any existing PeopleSoft customer can use it by taking advantage of the Oracle Cloud Service resources.

-   This is Oracle’s recommended way to deploy PeopleSoft on OCI.

#### Requirements for PCM

-   See the PeopleTools support information on PCM Home Page **(My Oracle Support, Doc ID 2231255.2)**.

-   See the requirements for OCI accounts, subscriptions, tenancy, and compartments in the Cloud Manager Installation tutorials at [Online Help for PeopleSoft Cloud Manager](https://docs.oracle.com/en/applications/peoplesoft/cloud-manager/index.html#InstallationTutorials).

-   You can also refer to the below PeopelSoft migration workflow diagram for your reference for migration to OCI in general.

![PeopelSoft migration workflow diagram](images/PeopelSoftMigrationPrerequisiteWorkflow.pdf)

#### High level Deployment steps using PCM

Using CM, one can provision a new environment or can perform a 'lift-and-shift' as depicted in the diagram below:

![PeopleSoft CM Provisioning High level Diagram](images/CM-Migration-1.pdf){width="60%" height="60%"}

How PeopleSoft CM can help to migrate PeopleSoft workload to OCI is depicted in the diagram below:

![PeopleSoft CM Migration High level Diagram](images/CM-Migration-2.pdf){width="60%" height="60%"}

-   If the Customer PeopleSoft estate is not compatible with CM, then we have to go for other migration options like manual Implementation.

-   Another scenario could be to move Customer Workload and/or other Solution components 'as-is' to OCI using Rackware or similar tool.

### Networking

## Oracle Security, Identity, and Compliance

Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) is designed to protect customer workloads with a security-first approach across compute, network, and storage – down to the hardware. It’s complemented by essential security services to provide the required levels of security for your most business-critical workloads.

-   [Security Strategy](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/cloud-adoption-framework/security-strategy.htm) – To create a successful security strategy and architecture for your deployments on OCI, it's helpful to understand Oracle's security principles and the OCI security services landscape.
-   The [security pillar capabilities](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/cloud-adoption-framework/security.htm#capabilities) reflect fundamental security principles for architecture, deployment, and maintenance. The best practices in the security pillar, help your organization to define a secure cloud architecture, identify and implement the right security controls, and monitor and prevent issues such as configuration drift.

## Compliance and Regulations

Cloud computing is fundamentally different from traditionally on-premises computing. In the traditional model, organizations are typically in full control of their technology infrastructure located on-premises (e.g., physical control of the hardware, and full control over the technology stack in production). In the cloud, organizations leverage resources and practices that are under the control of the cloud service provider, while still retaining some control and responsibility over other components of their IT solution. As a result, managing security and privacy in the cloud is often a shared responsibility between the cloud customer and the cloud service provider. The distribution of responsibilities between the cloud service provider and the customer also varies based on the nature of the cloud service (IaaS, PaaS, SaaS).
